-----------Need of identity?------------

Authentication - Iska mtlb hota han ki har banda ka pass ek identification hona
chahiye like ek bnda hn usko bank mein jana han tu wo agr waha ka employe hn tu
usko security gaurd ko apni identity btana pdegi entry ke lia apna card show krna
pdega.

Authorisation - iska mtlb hota hn ke apko kitna authorise kia gaya han jaisa ki
ek bank ke employe ko lockers ya aur bhi area ka excess nahi hota hai ..aur waha
ke jo manager hota hn unko access hn mtlb unko waha ki authorisation hn.

--------How to get enter in a program through different machines on web?------------

everthing is connect through the web called internet web.
every machinary is connected through this.
there are some terms as first we know that machine is  usaully known as IP address
and inside that every program have its own and identified port number (different)
around there are 65k diff. ports .

for examples- if a international client wants to know someones house (faraz house)
first of all he/she should know that client live in india then state (u.p) then in u.p
where he live (as jhashi) then in jhashi where and finally after all that he reached
home he should know the name of a person whom he want to meet in that house (port no)
what if two twins live in that house so the person should have clearification.
like that only to reach a machine we need a ip address then to access the machine
to find out the port we should know abt the port no. in which program is working.
(NOTE:In between this reverse proxy also works.)

After reading the above story we can have a common doubt in our mind that we use
443 port for all google chrome facebook etc but it isnt true its a port number
for https when a protocol is called in http then it comes to proxy which check
and sends the information to given port . Similarly we can send the info by Reverse
proxy.It is basically in scripted form (code language) so noone can understand in
between.


-----------{https://domain name or ip address.com:443}-----------
in above text there https is basically a protocol and 443 is nothing but a port no.
which works in https protocol.(here s in https indicates that this site is secured)
--------------------END----------------------


-----------why we use reverse domain name?-----------

Reverse-DNS names are a simple way of eliminating namespace collisions, since
any domain name is globally unique to its registered owner.

As for example - com.qtechlabs.calculator-applicatiom
here we can see the reverse domain as calculator-application is the actual name
of the program and com is the last word use at first .this help us to give unique
identity name so that we cannot have same name multiple software/program.here
qtechlabs is the domain name which is unique in the whole world web which make it
identical.


For eg- if three people made the apllicatrion of calcultor with different features
but with same  name as calculator-application and one genuine person is downloading
the application and that person wants to install all the three application but if he try
to dowmload that machine will say download but delte the existing one because this application
you already have but if he have its reverse domain name as com.atif.calculator-application,
(here atif is the universal  doamin name which make it world web unique) com.munaf.calculator-application,
com.faraz.calculator-application.now all these three have different names so a person can install all these
programs or applications.

These are called packages -(com.qtechlabs.calculator-application) as package is nothing
but containing many files inside it.
more over to cover it there are large libraries which consist of packages.
these large library are already made by peoples these are large codes which we use
one example of them is string[].
----------------------END-------------------------------

------------CONCEPT OF LIBRARY-------------

In lamen language libray is a programming library is a collection of
prewritten code that programmers can use to optimize tasks.

library is nothing but large files as in java programming library are .class files
Library are pre defined or made by the developer to make it easy for us in making
PROGRAM as we can use these libraries we do not have to make it we can take it
it is basically a container in which many files inserted we call it in the form of jar
files (java archieved) .

IN a JAVA program we have to make a class consist of  attributes and
method in it and a main method should be present in it getter and setter are
also methods.
A library also comes under mehtod in a java class .

------------END----------------

----------CONCEPT OF {CLIENT --> WEB APPLICATION --> DATABASE}-------------

FOR EXAMPLE-
when a client or user login or sign in FB . The client or user should sign in or
login in the GUI based appilication we give the information in it and the appilication
sends the informatiom to the web appilication and web appilication connects through a
program to DB(database) where all the information is saved or created or updated.

Basically database works on CRUD(create,redo,undo,delete).SO a web appilication connects
to the DB and do any of the work from CRUD.and then database gives back the info to the
web appilication through a program which created by a developer and the path is created
through  a client to web appilication is created by us.So now the DB gives the info
to web appilication and web appilication gives the info to the client.

This all process is done besides the application its a backview of how programs
/appilicationn run.
-------------END----------------
----------WHy we use web appilication in b/w a client and a database?-------------

As database have billions of info. inside it or different web appilication so it makes
typical to get the right info so fast and making it confusing so to resolve this conflict
we use a web appilication b/w the client and DB.
 ----------END-------------------
--------FORMATs---------
pom.xml - xml format it is
JSON - is a fromat for eg.-
{
"name" : "Mohd Atif",
"age" : "18",
"salary": "xyz"
}
----------------END----------------

-----------what are packages?----------
packages are basically folders.
as when we create a package its makes no.of folder in a reverse domain to make it unique.

--------------SYntext------------
The rules that control the structure of the symbols, punctuation, and words of
a programming language.

===================
-------STACK -------
===================

Jab hum java mein code ko run krte hain tu jvm(Java virtual machine) ke andr bht
sare workers hote hain thread ke andr basically thread phir kise ek worker ko bhejta
jiska naam main hain wo method ko chalata hain aur phir stack banna suru hote hain
basically boxes hote hn variable jisme value ati jati hain aur store hoti jate hain
phir jaisa jaisa unka use ho jata hn vaisa vaisa wo hatte jate hain. usko remove
kr dia jata hain.aur hum stack ko print kr skta hain , sou se . aur yh hame debug
ke time pr lines show hoti hain.
