                      -------GIT have two branches--------
1- Master
2- Develop
              -------------------GIT WORK--------------------
~IF we added a code in git first it is compiled in master then it copy paste as it is
in develop folder then if we are going to edit the code we get a new branch we can name it
and edit the code in it and merge it in develop then it get merge in master then the new code
is also saved in master and develop and the new branch got deleted when the code is compiled
ot merge in other two.

                    ---------WHy we need GIT?-----------

AS for example- if a client said to us to make a basic calculator program and we maked it
and give to the client he use it later he want some changes and we maked that changes in that
code as long as this goes on but what if someone wants the first version of it we maked,it again
need a manpower ,what if we saved that basic versi0n then we can directly give that code to the client
it makes us easier things.

For that reason we need a git program as its work is to make the first code as it is and the
later changes on it will save as a new code so that the old code is saved and new code is also
saved in another place.

Steps To make gitrepo in github through CLI
-------------------------------------------

Step 1 : Making a folder through command - mkdir <folder-name>
Step 2: Going in the Current Directory where the older is made - cd <folder-name>
Step 3: Now check by git status we can see there is no .git files so we make a .git
       file by intialising in it through - <git init> commands
Step 4: Now check by command git status or ls command we can see the .git file in it
Step 5 : we can make a folder in it by touch <file-name>
Step 6: we can edit a file of git by vim <file-name>
Step 7 : use git add . command to add all the changes in git repo or add <file-name>
        in this specific file will be added
Step 8:  use git commit -m "<message-which-you-want-to-give>"
       Now the file is saved with the changes .
Next step is done to send the file in github repo to save it there.
Step 9: pull command is used as -git pull- command
