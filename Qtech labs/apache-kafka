---------------APACHE KAFKA----------------

->A distributed streaming platform.

Detail:
Apache Kafka is a distributed data streaming platform that can publish,
subscribe to, store, and process streams of records in real time. It is designed
to handle data streams from multiple sources and deliver them to multiple consumers.
In short, it moves massive amounts of data—not just from point A to B,
but from points A to Z and anywhere else you need, all at the same time.

Messaging
=========

Messaging, very briefly, it’s just the act to send a message from one place to
another. It has three principal actors:

-->Producer: Who produces and send the messages to one or more queues;

-->Queue: A buffer data structure, that receives (from the producers) and
   delivers messages (to the consumers) in a FIFO (First-In First-Out) way.
   When a message is delivered, it’s removed forever from the queue, there’s
    no chance to get it back;

-->Consumer: Who is subscribed to one or more queues and receives their messages
    when published.
