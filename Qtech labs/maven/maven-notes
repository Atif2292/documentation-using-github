                           MAVEN -A build tool.

                    ///////////maven commands///////////
1- MVN clean
2- MVN compile
3- MVN build
4- MVN package
5- MVN install

Maven Coordinates
------------------
1) artifactID
2)GroupID
3)Version






Apache Tomcat - It is basically a web server. AS for example hmne ek program banaya
 aur usko run krne ke lia ya usko zinda rakhna ke lia ek client ke jrorat hoti hn
 jo isme tomcat hn yh application ko chalana ka kam krta on web.

 Yeah maven ke andr spring file ke andr hota hain.hume alag se isko download ni krna
 pdhta hai.maven basically class files ko .jar files bana deta hain (compile kr deta hain)
 aur folder mein dalkr run kr deta hain.

                  ---------Work of maven----------

~At first we make a maven project through eclipse then we name the group id as we name
packages in reverse domain name ....then we enter the name of the project.
then we save the file we get target file which can be deleted and pom.xml files
where ever we get pom.xml files it means its a maven project/file.
maven install command compile the class files then make .jar(java archieved) ->
[NOTE:java archieved file are nothing but zipped files which is packed in a container] files
jar files --> project name.jar files (build artifact).

Ab .m2 name se ek folder ban jayaga machinary pe jisse hm maven local repository bolta hai.
***
--> MAVEN main work is to create depedency work easy -
IF we have installed a library in maven project in depedency there always the Version
is hidden as when we installed a library it consist of many codes in it and many files
containing with many versions but maven make it easy as it identify itself and select a
right file version for it on which your maven project is working .

AS for example -
If a person working on a maven project and having a library of version 1 code in it which
works on version 1 but what if the on which app the user working on it got upgraded now
the user code of version 1 will not work on it so he have to install the another version
like this goes as if the version code only changed so he have to install a anither one
to resolve this conflict or problem maven build tool is use which automatically set the
Version. A lib having a many no. of files and version present in it to figure out in each
step it itself a headache.
